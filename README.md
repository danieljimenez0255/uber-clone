# React Native Uber Clone

Hello! This is my creation of the Uber App with
React Native

Super Excited to share this project with you!

In this project I utilize key React Native features

I also utilize the following:

    - React Navigation: Powerful and easy to implement screen navigation for each screen I needed for the app

    - ReduxJS: Powerful state management container used to access state anywhere in the application

    - Firebase: Powerful BaaS which I utilized firestore to store data securely

    - React Native Maps: Used for the map display of origin and destination

    - Expo Location: Used to set directions from current location to saved place

    - Tailwind: Utilized
    tailwind-react-native-classnames to bring tailwind styles to React Native

    - And so much more amazing tools. Check out the project to see more

## Make sure to have expo go app installed on your mobile device before checking out!!

The reason for the emphasis on this is because the link is going to take you to the project page with a qr code. The QR will need to be opened in the Expo Go App in order to view so make sure to have it installed!

And inspiration for this amazing project came from Sonny Sangha who is an amazing developer. If you want to see his version of the clone built step by step, click the link below to see:)
